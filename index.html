      <h3>Joshua Lian</h3>
      <p> A Malaysian here, and now studying in City remotely during Term 1. Due to jet lag, I have 
	to attend the lectures or tutorials in the evening .It's a special experience for me I think
	that learning in night time. I have a little experience of programming before, just knowing 
	some basic concept like classes and loops, but not in Java. So I feel like that is a kind of cool 
	stuff when doing the project. Hope to enter the campus soon!

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	I have created a classic Snake Game which used to played in Nokia. My first programming project 
	demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of classes, arrays, and loops . 
	The snake is controlled by the player using 'WASD' and each time get the food it becomes longer and longer.
	Your high score will be recorded, try to beat youself !

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	This is a platform game that I developed as part of the teaching the Programming in Java module to first year Computer Science students at City, University of London.
    </p>
      <p>
The game has the main character, a penguin with a helmet, which also know some magic too. It can be moved and interacted with via the keyboard, like pressing 'k' can do some magic stuff and attack enemies. The enemies will sensor the hero when we are close to it and start shooting the hero. We will get score every time the enemies been shooted. And sure the score is relavant to the time, the less time you use, the more points you get.
          </p>
      <p>
The game features a background soundtrack and sounds effect for different game effect, like shooting or pickups. And the bckground changes for different levels.Hope you like the game!
